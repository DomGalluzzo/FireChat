FireChat is a live chatting web application built to teach myself `Firebase`, and to learn how a `NoSQL` database works. It is deployed/hosted through `Firebase Hosting`.

It was built using:
- `React`
- `Firestore`
- `Authentication` through Google Sign In
- `Anonymous authentication` to allow guest sign in
